# Restaurant Website Project

Welcome to the readme file for my personal project, a restaurant website. This project serves as a practical demonstration of the skills and concepts I've learned, including the use of Flexbox for responsive layouts, implementing a responsive navbar, incorporating image overlays, and effectively using the `position: relative` and `position: absolute` CSS properties.

## Project Overview

The **Restaurant Website** project showcases my ability to create a visually appealing and responsive website for a restaurant. By leveraging the skills I've acquired, I've successfully implemented various features that enhance the website's usability and aesthetics.

## Features

### 1. Responsive Layouts with Flexbox

I've utilized Flexbox, a powerful CSS layout model, to ensure that the website's layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. This results in an optimal user experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### 2. Responsive Navbar

The website features a navbar that adjusts according to the screen size. The navigation menu collapses into a dropdown menu on smaller screens, enhancing the website's mobile-friendliness and ease of navigation.

### 3. Image Overlays

To add a touch of interactivity and visual appeal, I've incorporated image overlays. When users hover over certain images, additional information or visual effects are displayed, providing an engaging user experience.

### 4. Positioning Techniques

I've applied the `position: relative` and `position: absolute` CSS properties strategically to achieve specific layout and design goals. This includes precise placement of elements within containers and creating layered effects to enhance the website's aesthetics.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: For structuring the website's content.
- CSS3: For styling and layout, including Flexbox and positioning properties.
- JavaScript: For any interactive elements or dynamic behavior.
- Responsive Design: Ensuring the website looks and functions well on various devices.
- Version Control (e.g., Git): Managing and tracking changes to the project.

## Conclusion

The **Restaurant Website** project demonstrates my proficiency in creating responsive and visually appealing websites using Flexbox for layouts, implementing responsive navigation, integrating image overlays, and effectively using CSS positioning techniques. This project reflects the knowledge and skills I've gained, and I'm excited to continue expanding my expertise in web development.
